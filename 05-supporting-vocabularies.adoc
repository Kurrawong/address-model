== Supporting Vocabularies

This model has several classes that are subclasses of the generic vocabulary/taxonomy item class http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept[`skos:Concept`]. The classes are:

. <<AddressComponentTypes, Address Component Types>>
. <<AddressLifecycleStageTypes, Address Lifecycle Stage Types>>
. <<AddressRoleTypes, Address Role Type>>
. <<AddressStatusTypes, Address Status Types>>

Individuals of these classes must be instances of the particular class and must also be Concepts selected from controlled vocabularies of instances.

This profile contains vocabularies for these class types derived from <<ISO19160-1>>. Ceoncepts in these vocabularies are from the standard plus additions specified for ANZ.

Concepts from vocabularies other than those specified here may be use with this model as long as the vocabulary items are dual-classed as `skos:Concept` and the relevant model class, e.g. `addr:AddressComponentType`.

NOTE: The representations of vocabularies here do not contain full vocabulary information such as concept hierarchy. Please see the vocabularies' own documentation for full details.

=== Address Component Types Vocabulary

This vocabulary is an extended version of <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressComponentType` vocabulary. The original 9 concepts from the standard are included however only two of them - `locality` & `postcode` - are suggested for use. 19 additional concepts are taken from address elements in the G-NAF, such as `numberFirstSuffix`. Additional concepts are added as needed to cater for futher ANZ addressing needs, such as `traditionalPlaceName` to cater for First Nations place naming.
