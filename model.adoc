=== Terms & Definitions

The following terms appear in this document and, when they do, the definitions in this section apply to them.

==== Knowledge Graph

A Knolwedge Graph is a dataset that uses a graph data tructure - nodes and edges - with strongly-defined elements.

==== Linked Data

A set of technologies and conventions defined by the link:https://www.w3.org[World Wide Web Consortium] that aim to present data in both human- and machine-readable form over the Internet. 

Linked Data is strongly-defined with each element having either a local definition or a link to an available definition on the Internet.

Linked Data is graph-based in nature, that is it consistes of nodes and edges that can forever be linked to further conceps with defined relationships.

-- https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data

==== Semantic Web

The link:https://www.w3.org[World Wide Web Consortium]'s vision of an Internet-based web of Linked Data. 

Semantic Web is used to refer to something more than just the technologies and conventions of Linked Data; the term also encompases a specific set of interoperable data models - often called ontologies - published by the W3C, other standards bodies and some well-known companies.

The 'semantic' refers to the strongly-defined nature of the elements in the Semantic Web: the meaning of Semantic Web data is as precicely defined as any data can be.
