== Preamble

=== Abstract

[NOTE]
This Model is a candidate model for Australian & New Zealand address information. It is currently an unofficial model that is not yet published as a standard.

This model is a Semantic Web data model used for address information. It is based primarilty on the ISO19160-1 _Addressing Part 1: Conceptual model_ <<ISO19160-1>> with additional elements from a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models such as GeoSPARQL <<GEO>> and SKOS <<SKOS>>.

=== Namespaces

This model is built on a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models which use a variatey of namespaces. Prefixes for this namespaces, used througout this document, are listed below.

=== Conformance

This model conforms to the https://w3id.org/profile/ontpub[OntPub Profile] which is a specification for ontology publication that mandates certain structural and metadata properties for the model as a whole and model elements. Metadata elements for the model as a whole - the ontology - are given in the <<Metadata>> section above.

== Introduction

In 2021, the https://www.icsm.gov.au/[Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping] established an https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-2035[Addressing 2035] strategy that aimed to "provide leadership, coordination and standards for assembling, delivering and maintaining address datasets". The Strategy listed "Strategic Pillars", such as "Jurisdictional
flexibility" - things for Strategy implementers to aim for - "Guiding Principles", "Overarching Pain Points" and other system/model/situation requirements. It did not present an address model.

This model is created with alignment to the Addressing 2035 Strategy as a high priority, so it's use aims to address Pain Points identified in the Strategy.

The model is mostly an based on the structures of International Addressing standard, ISO19160-1, but this model is expressed in Semantic Web form. Unlike ISO19160-1, this model also re-uses elements from other, well-known, Semantic Web models, as is the Semantic Web norm.

This model does not model _all_ of address data managers' concerns: it leaves things like the detailed modellign os spatial information to other models or extensions to this model. Also, by reusing elements from well-known Semantic Web models, this model has many "pick-up" points that can be used to join other information on to. For example, the `Resource` indicated as an `Address Component` value, may be a locally-defined simple value type - a number or string - but it may also be a complex object defined elsewhere, such as a `Locality`.

=== Model resources

This document is this model's "Specification" which is its authoratitive, human-readable, definition document. This model also contains other resources with other roles:

== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. While some of the properties are restricted in their use to various classes, the Classes and Properties are actually defined individually and both are "first class model citizens", with golbal identity, that can be used in isolation as well as together. This is in contrast to Unified Modelling Language (UML) _Class Diagrams_ which treat Properties as sub-parts of particular classes.

This model defines some Classes and Properties and also requires certain existing Cs & Ps for reuse. All Cs & Ps in this model, both defined and reused, are listed here with an indication of where the element is difined given in the _Is Defined By_ field.

[[AddressableObject]]
==== Addressable Object

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `add:AddressableObject`
| Preferred Label | Addressable Object
| Definition | An object that is unambiguously determined by an address.

Examples of types of AddressableObjects are a building, a dwelling or a land parcel
| Is Defined By | http://w3id.org/profile/anz-address/[ANZ National Address Model]
| Sub-class Of | https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html#_class_geofeature[`geo:Feature`]
| Provenance | Derived from <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressableObject` class and its associated codelist of subtypes
| Usage note | Judgement as to what makes for a permissable AddressableObject rests with the implementer. This model's technical requirements are only that the object is a legal `geo:Feature` object, thus implementers may make Addressable Objects of almost anything.
| Expected Properties | <<hasAddress>>, http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#[`geo:hasGeometry`]
| Example 
a| [source,turtle]
----
# ex:parcel-x is inferred to be an Addressable object

[cols="2,6"]

| Property | Value

| IRI | `add:AddressComponent`

| Definition | A component that is a constituent part of an address
| Is Defined By | http://w3id.org/profile/anz-address/[ANZ National Address Model]
| Sub-class Of | http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource[`rdfs:Resource`]
| Provenance | Derived from <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressComponent` class
| Usage note | Address Components can be literals - numbers, words etc. - or complex ojects - Localities, districtes etc. If the Address Component is a complex object, a textual representation of it must be provided when a textual rendering of all of an Addresses' component are required, for example for letter printing. 

Complex objects are preferred for use over literals when the object referred to has independent identity.

Ordering of Address Components, for example for letter printing, is not fixed within this model but should be implemented with a positioning preference system utilising the Address Component's `addr:hasComponentType` values which should come from a controlled vocabulary of Address Component Type values.

== Supporting Vocabularies

This model has several classes that are subclasses of the generic vocabulary/taxonomy item class http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept[`skos:Concept`]. The classes are:

. <<AddressComponentType, Address Component Type>>
. <<AddressLifecycleStageType, Address Lifecycle Stage Type>>
. <<AddressRole, Address Role>>
. <<AddressStatus, Address Status>>

Individuals of these classes must be instances of the particular class and must also be Concepts selected from controlled vocabularies of instances. 

This profile contains vocabularies for these class types derived from <<ISO19160-1>>. Ceoncepts in these vocabularies are from the standard plus additions specified for ANZ.

Concepts from vocabularies other than those specified here may be use with this model as long as the vocabulary items are dual-classed as `skos:Concept` and the relevant model class, e.g. `addr:AddressComponentType`.

NOTE: The representations of vocabularies here do not contain full vocabulary information such as concept hierarchy. Please see the vocabularies' own documentation for full details.
