It is informed by the ICSM's Addressing 2035: Addressing Reform and Innovation for Australia and New Zealand, published in late 2021 and is based primarilty on the ISO19160-1 Addressing Part 1: Conceptual model with additional elements from a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models such as GeoSPARQL and SKOS. It is also informed by the relational databalse model used for the G-NAF, Australia's Geocoded National Address File, and CSIRO work in 2018 to characterise the GNAF in Sematic Web form, the ontlogy for which is online at https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf.
